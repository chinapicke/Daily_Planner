# Daily_Planner
## Description 
Daily planner created to help with scheduling information within the working hours of the day between 9am and 5pm. Information is stored on the page one the user selects the button with the specific time slot, even when it is refreshed. The time slots represent whether it is before, during or after the current hour. If the time slot is before the current time, the time slot is indicated as grey, if the time slot is during the current time the time slot is indicated as red, if the time slot is after the current time then the time slot is indicated as green. The date is also represented as the top of the page, this changes on a daily basis.

This project utilises: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and JQuery. There is also use of font awesome for the icons used in the buttons

This was also first project using jQuery, te challenge was trying to save the information that the user was inputting to then display it later; this is due to having to use sibling() and use a combination of val() and text()to display the user input so that it is not undefined.
